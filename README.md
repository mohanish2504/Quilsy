# Quilsy
Converted core idea of this app to [Synqnest](https://synqnest.com)

## Motivation
- Idea was to create an app for both Android and iOS which can catch copy/cut events directly from os and keep it in live sync between devices.
- Combining above feature with additional section of notes havings all the major fucntionality like word/google docs was a plus point.
- To give users a quick access we also added a floating widget functionality in Android app, which allows user directly copy from their and also it does include search functionality
- I have personally felt that this kind of app was missing in the market.

## Tech Stack
- For Mobile Application I have used Flutter
- Backend was coded using Django Framwork.

## Screen Shots and Video
- This link contains all the screen shots and video: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BooHS-UzwYInimgWyrGPB622A6N61T46?usp=sharing

## Reasons to discontinue.
- As both Google and Apple are focused more and more privacy, it makes it difficult to have a copy event on both the os together.
- While android allows it to some extend with some additonal permissions, iOS doesn't allow copy events from outside app.
